This is the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin greenhouse lighting experiment app for iOS.
The experiment explores the potential of light emitting diode (LED) powered lighting in greenhouses. 
The app is used to track pollination behavior of insects while varying the wavelength of the illumination.
Unfortunately, there is no Android app yet...

This code is open source. Please refer to the file "License.txt".

This is the main experiment page, where we track the insects actions with time-stamped events.
